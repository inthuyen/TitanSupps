This is the SQL dump folder

This is where all the necessary SQL scripts for our project can be found.

To get started, open myPHPAdmin and select the appropriate database (final). 

From there, you can navigate to the SQL tab and select the "Import" option. Choose the SQL script you wish to run and click "Go" to execute the script.

Please back up or dump your database before running any SQL scripts to avoid any potential data loss.
To do this select your database on the left tab, click the export menu option at the top, then click the export button at the bottom.
